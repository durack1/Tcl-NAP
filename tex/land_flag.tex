\section{The \texttt{nap\_land\_flag} Command}
    \label{land-flag}
    \label{land-flag-nap-land-flag}

The \texttt{nap\_land\_flag} command
defines land/sea masks.
The data has an accuracy of 0.01$^{\circ}$ of latitude/longitude.

This command is normally used via the functions 
\texttt{is\_land}
(see section \ref{geog-is-land})
and 
\texttt{is\_coast}
(see section \ref{geog-is-coast})
rather than directly.

The \texttt{nap\_land\_flag} command
is based on code which was originally written by
Dr. Chris. Mutlow at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in England.
This code has been adapted for Nap by Peter Turner and Harvey Davies.
