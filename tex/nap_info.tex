\section{The \texttt{nap\_info} Command}
    \label{nap-info}

The 
  \texttt{nap\_info} command provides information (mainly about the
  Nap system). There are three variants which are shown in the
  following example:
  \begin{verbatim}
% nap_info bytes
2692 2920 68216 68224
% nap_info seconds
12.519
% nap_info sequence
15
\end{verbatim}

  

The command `\texttt{nap\_info bytes}' provides information about
  Nap's use of memory. This use falls into the following three
  categories:
\begin{bullets}
    \item direct use for 
    \emph{NAOs} within a Tcl interpreter
    \item 
    \emph{other} purposes local to a Tcl interpreter
    \item 
    \emph{global} purposes
\end{bullets}
There can be multiple Tcl interpreters, each with its own Nap.
  No statistics are available on 
  \emph{global} memory usage. The command `\texttt{nap\_info bytes}' returns the following four numbers
  relating to Nap's memory usage within the current Tcl
  interpreter:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item current number of bytes of memory being used by 
    \emph{NAOs} (2692 in above example)
    \item maximum number of bytes used by 
    \emph{NAOs} at any time so far (2920 in above example)
    \item current number of bytes of memory being used for 
    \emph{other} purposes (68216 in above example)
    \item maximum number of bytes used for 
    \emph{other} purposes at any time so far (68224 in above
    example)
  \end{enumerate}
  

The command `\texttt{nap\_info seconds}' returns the processor time used
  by tcl, as defined by the C function `\texttt{clock()}'.
  

The command `\texttt{nap\_info sequence}' returns the sequence-number of
  the most recently created NAO.
