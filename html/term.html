<h3>Arrays</h3>

<dl>

    <dt>
	scalar
    <dd>
	array with 0 dimensions i.e. a simple number, character, etc.

    <dt>
	vector
    <dd>
	array with 1 dimension.

    <dt>
	matrix
    <dd>
	array with 2 dimensions.

    <dt>
	dimension-size
    <dd>
	number of values along a dimension.

    <dt>
	shape
    <dd>
	vector of dimension-sizes of array.

    <dt>
	rank
    <dd>
	number of dimensions (a.k.a. dimensionality) i.e. shape of shape.

    <dt>
	row
    <dd>
	final (least-significant) dimension

    <dt>
	dimension-name
    <dd>
	name given to dimension e.g. &quot;latitude&quot;.

    <dt>
	coordinate-variable (CV)
    <dd>
	vector (usually sorted) associated with a dimension of the same size.
	CVs are
	often used to map an array's dimensions to physical dimensions such as length and time,
	thus locating the array elements in physical space and time.

</dl>

<h3>Special Numeric Values</h3>

<dl>
    <dt>
	missing-value (MV)
    <dd>
	numeric value of data which is abnormal in some way such as:
	<li>not applicable (e.g. land point for ocean data)
	<li>not available (e.g. instrument failure or delay in obtaining data)
	<li>result of some illegal operation such as dividing 0 by 0
	<li>undefined for some other reason

    <dt>
	infinity
    <dd>
	floating-point value representing a value which is too large
	(or small in the case of negative infinity) to represent.
	This can result from operations such as dividing by 0.

    <dt>
	NaN (not-a-number)
    <dd>
	floating-point value resulting from an illegal operation such as dividing 0 by 0.
</dl>
