Ken Iverson (who died in 2004) is the father of array processing.
NAP does not use the radical mathematical conventions of his languages
<a href="http://www.acm.org/sigapl/">APL</a>,
and
<a href="http://www.jsoftware.com/">J</a>,
but he must be acknowledged as the source of the fundamental concepts upon which NAP is based.
NAP has also adopted various J conventions such as that for floating-point constants 
(e.g. allowing 0.5 to be written in rational form as <code>1r2</code>
and allowing powers of &pi; as in <code>1p1</code>).

<p>
NAP would never have happened if the author (Harvey Davies) had not worked with
Rhys Francis and Ian Mathieson
on development of the data-parallel modelling language <em>DPML</em>
and learned from them things like <em>yacc</em>.
This project met a premature death but we did learn a lot.
It is hoped to implement unit calculus (automatic unit conversion and definition)
in NAP as was done in DPML.

<p>
The other strong influence on NAP was 
<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/index.html">netCDF</a>.
It is amazing that a portable array file format did not exist until
Russ Rew and the late Glenn Davis developed netCDF in the early 1990s.
This work was based on 
<a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cdf/cdf_home.html">CDF</a>,
which was developed by Michael Gough and Lloyd Treinish.
NAP is designed to read and write netCDF (and the similar
<a href="http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu">HDF</a>)
files and stores data in memory in stuctures called
<em>NAOs</em>, which have similar properties to netCDF variables.

<p>
Peter Turner (now with CSIRO Marine Research) 
made significant contributions to the NAP code.
He wrote the C code for:
<ul>
    <li> NAO photo-image handler
    <li> <em>draw</em> and <em>fill</em> OOC methods
    <li> morphological functions (moving_range, dilate, erode)
</ul>
He also made significant contributions to the following Tcl library files:
<code>
<ul>
    <li> browse_var.tcl
    <li> caps_nap_menu.html
    <li> colour.tcl
    <li> hdf.tcl
    <li> pal.tcl
    <li> plot_nao.tcl
    <li> proc_lib.tcl
</ul>
</code>

<P>
The
<a href="land_flag.html"><code>nap_land_flag</code></a>
commmand is based on code which was originally written by
Dr. Chris. Mutlow at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in England.             
This code has been adapted for NAP by Peter Turner and Harvey Davies.

<p>
Past and present members of The CAPS development group 
(Ian Grant,
Edward King,
Jenny Lovell,
Paul Tildesley,
Peter Turner
and
Chris Rathbone)
have provided ideas, support and feedback over the years.
Mark Collier and Janice Bathols were early users of NAP for processing results from
atmospheric modelling.
Their success and enthusiasm has has done a great deal to convert others to <em>napism</em>.
Paul Durack produced the PDF version of the User's Guide.

<P>
Dr Takeshi Enomoto, Earth Simulator Center,
maintains the 
<a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/pdb/package.php/nap">nap Fink site</a>,
which provides distributions for the <em>Mac OS X</em> and <em>Darwin</em> platforms.
