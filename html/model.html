Data Models
</center> </h2>

<p>
A <em>data model</em> is a mental model of the nature of some data.
It answers such questions as the following:

<h3>What values can the data take?</h3>

Are they all numeric?
Are they all integers?
Is the set of possible values finite?
What are the minimum and maximum possible values?
Are &infin; and <em>NaN</em> possible values?
Do some values have special meanings, such as indicating undefined or
missing data?

<h3>What is the measurement level?</h3>

<p>
Data is often classified as follows according to <i>measurement level</i>:

<p>
<table border>

    <tr>
	<th align=center>Name<br>of<br>Level
	<th align=center>Description
	<th align=center>Valid<br>Operations
	<th align=center>Appropriate<br>Measure of<br>Central&nbsp;Tendency
	<th align=center>Examples

    <tr>
	<td> nominal
	<td> values denote categories<br>which have no order
	<td> = &ne;
	<td> mode
	<td> color, postal code (e.g. zip)<br>
	    chemical species (e.g. CO<sub>2</sub>)

    <tr>
	<td> ordinal
	<td> values are ordered<br>differences meaningless
	<td> = &ne; &lt; &le; &gt; &ge; 
	<td> median
	<td> Richter earthquake scale<br>dates in form YYYYMMDD

    <tr>
	<td> interval
	<td> differences are valid<br>quotients meaningless
	<td> = &ne; &lt; &le; &gt; &ge;<br>+ &minus;
	<td> arithmetic mean
	<td> temperature in &deg;C

    <tr>
	<td> ratio
	<td> quotients are valid
	<td> = &ne; &lt; &le; &gt; &ge;<br>+ &minus; &times; &divide;
	<td> geometric mean
	<td> temperature in &deg;K


</table>

<h3>How accurate are the values?</h3>

<p>
A <em>measurement error</em> is the difference between the <em>true value</em> and the 
<em>measured value</em>.
Measured values can differ from true values due to:
<ul>
<li> finite precision of instrument
<li> systematic errors (e.g. inadequately calibrated instrument)
<li> random errors (due to finite size of sample)
<li> sampling errors (due to non-randomness of sample)
<li> blunders (e.g. a human misreading an instrument)
</ul>
It is desirable to include error estimates with data.

<h3>Are the data located in some space?</h3>

<p>
A <em>time series</em> consists of values located along the time dimension.
<em>Geographic</em> data is located along spatial dimensions such as latitude, longitude and 
altitude and may also have a time dimension.
Note that longitude is <em>cyclic</em>.

<p>
The dimensions of the space can have a measurement level of <em>nominal</em>.
For example, an accounting spreadsheet might have columns corresponding to 
<em>charge codes </em>
and rows corresponding to <em>company divisions</em>.

<p>
Data located in a continuous space can be either <em>gridded</em> or <em>scattered</em>.
Both types are discussed in
<a href="grid.html">NAP Grids</a>.
