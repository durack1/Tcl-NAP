# This file is sourced either when an application starts up or
# by a "package unknown" script.  It invokes the
# "package ifneeded" command to set up package-related
# information so that packages will be loaded automatically
# in response to "package require" commands.  When this
# script is sourced, the variable $dir must contain the
# full path name of this file's directory.
#
# Note that following apparently redundant command
# set dir $dir
# defines another variable called "dir" within uplevel.
